# Wellâ€‘being Waitlist

Wellâ€‘being Waitlist is a hospital portal that prioritizes patient checkups using **precomputed emergency levels** (no LLM needed), making the system faster and more efficient.

## Project Overview

- **System goal:** Dynamically manage patient queue by emergency priority.
- **Updated flow:** Users submit patient problem â†’ mapped to precomputed emergency level â†’ patient is queued in a maxâ€‘heap.
- On each **checkâ€‘up**:
  - Highestâ€‘priority patient is removed.
  - Remaining patientsâ€™ emergency levels increase by a fixed increment (e.g. +5).
- User interface updates in real time to reflect current queue.

## Tech Stack

| Layer       | Tools & Frameworks                    |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| Backend     | Spring Boot (Java), REST API          |
| Frontend    | React.js, Tailwind CSS                |
| Data Store  | MySQL                                 |

## ðŸš€ How It Works (Updated Flow)

1. Patient problem is submitted through the React frontend.
2. The backend maps the problem to a **precomputed emergency level** (LLM will only required when data is not found on precomputed emergency levels).
3. Patient data is inserted into a **max-heap** based on emergency priority.
4. Upon checkup:
   - Highest priority patient is removed.
   - All remaining patientsâ€™ emergency level increases (e.g., by +5).
5. Frontend reflects real-time updates.
